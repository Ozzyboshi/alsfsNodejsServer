# alsfsNodejsServer

AlsfsNodejsServer is part of a lager project which lets you control your amiga filesystem remotely using simple http request.
AlsfsNodejsServer communicates with real Amigas by a null modem cable you have to buy or build, for this reason you will need a serial port available on your PC, if you don't have one it's possible to use an usb to serial converter.
AlsfsNodejsServer works on Docker and Raspberry Pi.
